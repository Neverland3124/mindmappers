## Brief Description
Our web application is a collaborative mind-mapping tool designed to facilitate real-time brainstorming and idea organization for individuals and teams. The application leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive user experience, ensuring that users can easily create, modify, and share their mind maps. Key features include a Single Page Application (SPA) front end built with Angular, a robust backend powered by Express, and seamless integration with third-party services like ChatGPT.

## Required Elements
- **Use modern frameworks**
  - Frontend is written in SPA
- **Use Express as core backend API**
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Use RESTful API**
- **Deploy using Docker**
- **Use third-party API such as ChatGPT**
  - During dragging, the text is sent to ChatGPT, which provides an image to display
  - [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech)
- **Use OAuth 2.0 as the sign-in system**
  - Google OAuth2 is chosen to be the authorization mechanism
  - [Google OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

## Additional Requirements
- **Use webhook**
  - Implement webhooks to receive notifications from external services
  - Use webhook to trigger email updates when another user modifies your collaborative mind map
  - Technology: SendGrid
  - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/pricing)
- **Real-time collaboration**
  - Different users can work on the same mind map board and see each otherâ€™s movements and changes
  - Socket.io: To connect users that join the same room for a mindmap
  - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)

## Alpha Version Milestones
